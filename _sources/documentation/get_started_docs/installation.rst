Installation
############

Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) currently doesn't provide a
binary distribution and can be built only from the sources.

.. _system_requirements_reference_link:

System Requirements
*******************

Intel® QPL supports only the Intel 64 platform.

Software Path Requirements
==========================

The execution using Software Path does not imply any specific requirements on a system
besides resolving :ref:`Build Prerequisites <building_library_prerequisites_reference_link>`.
Intel® QPL relies on a run-time kernels dispatcher and CPUID check to choose
the best available implementation.

| **Minimal tested platform**
| x86-64 CPU with Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions 4.2
  (Intel® microarchitecture code name Nehalem).

| **Recommended requirements for better performance**
| x86-64 CPU with Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 support
  (Intel® microarchitecture code name Skylake (Server) processor or higher).

.. _system_requirements_hw_path_reference_link:

Hardware Path Requirements
==========================

Execution using Hardware Path available only on Linux* OS.

Additionally, the operating system must meet the following requirements:

- Linux kernel version 5.18 or later is required for using the first generation of Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA).
- Linux kernel version 6.3 or later is required for using the second generation of Intel® IAA.
- Virtualization technology for directed I/O (VT-d) is enabled through the BIOS menu.
  For details on setup, please refer to "Intel® In-Memory Analytics Accelerator (Intel® IAA) User Guide".

.. _accelerator_configuration_reference_link:

Accelerator Configuration
*************************

Intel® IAA device can be configured with the ``libaccel-config`` library,
which can be found at https://github.com/intel/idxd-config.

Intel® QPL provides a way to configure Intel® IAA through calling
either of the following commands based on whether you are setting up
via the Intel® QPL source or from the Intel® QPL installed directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 <qpl-library>/tools/scripts/accel_conf.py --load=<path to config file>

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 <install-dir>/share/QPL/scripts/accel_conf.py <config file> --load=<path to config file>

With configuration files found at either ``<qpl-library>/tools/configs/`` or ``<install-dir>/share/QPL/configs/``.
With configuration files of the format ``<# nodes>n<# devices>d<# engines>e<# of workqueues>w-s.conf`` or
``<# nodes>n<# devices>d<# engines>e<# of workqueues>w-s-n<which node>.conf``.

Alternatively, users can use the following commands to directly configure the device with the ``accel-config``:

.. code-block:: shell

   accel-config load-config -c <config file>
   accel-config enable-device <device>
   accel-config enable-wq <device>/<wq>

.. attention::

   Either sudo privileges or elevated permissions are required to configure Intel® IAA instance.

   If user is non-root, sysadmin with root privileges should give users access to special groups.

   .. code-block:: shell

      useradd iax
      passwd iax
      chown -R iax /dev/iax
      su iax

   Starting from ``accel config`` 3.2, all devices are configured with the ``dsadev`` group, so users can run Intel QPL without root privileges if they belong to that group.

Building the Library
********************

.. _building_library_prerequisites_reference_link:

Prerequisites
=============

Before building Intel® QPL, install and set up the following tools:

**Linux\* OS:**

- nasm 2.15.0 or higher (e.g., can be obtained from https://www.nasm.us)

- Intel QPL requires C++ compiler with C++17 standard support.
  For instance, GCC 8.2+ (or Clang 12.0.1+ for building fuzz tests).

- Universally Unique ID library ``uuid-dev`` version 2.35.2 or higher

- CMake* version 3.16.3 or higher. If Intel QPL is build with ``-DSANITIZE_THREADS=ON``, use CMake* version 3.23 or higher
  (see :ref:`building_library_build_options_reference_link`)

- GNU Make

Additionally, ``libaccel-config`` library version 4.0 or higher may be required
when building and running Intel QPL with certain build options (see
:ref:`building_library_build_options_reference_link` for more details).
Refer to `accel-config releases <https://github.com/intel/idxd-config/releases>`__ for the
latest version.

.. attention::

   Currently, the accelerator configuration library officially offers only a dynamic version, ``libaccel-config.so``.
   By default, Intel QPL loads ``libaccel-config.so`` dynamically with ``dlopen``, but static loading can be enabled
   using the build option ``-DDYNAMIC_LOADING_LIBACCEL_CONFIG=OFF`` (see the :ref:`building_library_build_options_reference_link` section).
   The default dynamic loading is recommended, because in that case ``libaccel-config.so`` will not be a compile-time dependency,
   and if the application uses only the Software Path, ``libaccel-config.so`` will not be a runtime dependency. The static loading
   option is provided as an alternative to users who may have concerns with using dynamic loading in their applications.

.. attention::

   See the :ref:`building_library_build_options_reference_link` section for additional requirements on ``libaccel-config``
   under different conditions.

**Windows\* OS:**

- nasm 2.15.0 or higher (can be obtained from https://www.nasm.us, for example,
  `nasm-2.15.05-installer-x64.exe <https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.15.05/win64/nasm-2.15.05-installer-x64.exe>`__)

- MSVC 14.1 or higher

- CMake* version 3.16.3 or higher

- Microsoft NMAKE

.. _building_library_build_options_reference_link:

Available Build Options
=======================

Intel QPL supports the following build options:

-  ``-DSANITIZE_MEMORY=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables memory sanitizing (``OFF`` by default).
-  ``-DSANITIZE_THREADS=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables threads sanitizing (``OFF`` by default).

.. attention::

   Options ``-DSANITIZE_THREADS=ON`` and ``-DSANITIZE_MEMORY=ON`` are incompatible and
   can not be used for the same build.

.. attention::

   If Intel QPL is build with ``-DSANITIZE_THREADS=ON``, use CMake* version 3.23 or higher to avoid issue with finding pthread library in FindThreads.

-  ``-DLOG_HW_INIT=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables hardware initialization log (``OFF`` by default).
-  ``-DEFFICIENT_WAIT=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables usage of efficient wait instructions (``OFF`` by default).
-  ``-DLIB_FUZZING_ENGINE=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables fuzz testing (``OFF`` by default).
-  ``-DQPL_BUILD_EXAMPLES=[OFF|ON]`` - Enables building library examples (``ON`` by default).
   For more information on existing examples, see :ref:`code_examples_c_reference_link`.

-  ``-DQPL_BUILD_TESTS=[OFF|ON]`` - Enables building library testing and benchmarks frameworks (``ON`` by default).
   For more information on library testing, see :ref:`library_testing_reference_link` section.
   For information on benchmarking the library, see :ref:`library_benchmarking_reference_link`.

-  ``-DDYNAMIC_LOADING_LIBACCEL_CONFIG=[OFF|ON]`` - Enables loading the accelerator configuration library (``libaccel-config``)
   dynamically with dlopen (``ON`` by default).

.. attention::

   If Intel QPL is built with ``-DDYNAMIC_LOADING_LIBACCEL_CONFIG=ON``, which is the default value,
   ``libaccel-config`` will be loaded dynamically with lazy binding, which means that if the application
   uses only the Software Path, the user does not need to have ``libaccel-config`` installed. If the Hardware Path is used,
   the user has to either place ``libaccel-config`` in ``/usr/lib64/`` or specify the location of ``libaccel-config``
   in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` for the dynamic loader to find it.

.. attention::

   If Intel QPL is built with ``-DDYNAMIC_LOADING_LIBACCEL_CONFIG=OFF``, which is the non-default value,
   ``libaccel-config`` will be loaded statically and it will be a dependency
   at both compile-time and runtime. And it is required to add ``libaccel-config`` library to the link line (``-laccel-config``) when
   building an application with the Intel QPL. The user has to either place ``libaccel-config`` in ``/usr/lib64/`` or specify the
   location of ``libaccel-config`` (for example, using ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``LIBRARY_PATH``). Since there may be different versions
   of ``libaccel-config`` on a system, the user is advised to create a symbolic link between ``libaccel-config.so`` and
   ``libaccel-config.so.1`` to avoid potential compatibility issues.

- ``-DQPL_LIBRARY_TYPE=[SHARED|STATIC]`` - Enables building the library as a shared library or a static library (``STATIC`` by default).

-  ``-DQPL_USE_CLANG_TIDY=[ON|OFF]`` - Enables clang-tidy checks (``OFF`` by default).

.. attention::

   ``clang-tidy`` checks are limited to Linux OS only.
   To use ``clang-tidy``, the user should install Clang and clang-tidy tools and build QPL with Clang compiler.

.. _building_library_build_reference_link:

Build Steps
===========

To build Intel QPL (by default it includes building examples, tests
and benchmarks framework as well), complete the following steps:

1. Make sure that :ref:`system_requirements_reference_link` are met
   and all the tools from the :ref:`building_library_prerequisites_reference_link`
   section are available in your environment.

2. Clone git sources using the following command:


   .. code-block:: shell

      git clone --recursive https://github.com/intel/qpl.git <qpl_library>

.. attention::

   ``--recursive`` is required for downloading sub-module dependencies for testing
   and benchmarking Intel QPL.

.. attention::

   To build Intel QPL from the GitHub release package (``.tar``, ``.tgz``)
   or without downloading sub-module dependencies for testing and benchmarking,
   use ``-DQPL_BUILD_TESTS=OFF``.

3. Build the library and tests by executing the following commands in ``<qpl_library>``:


   **Linux\* OS:**

   .. code-block:: shell

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> ..
      cmake --build . --target install


   **Windows\* OS:**

   .. code-block:: shell

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
      cmake --build . --target install

4. The resulting library will be available in the folder ``<install_dir>/lib/``.

Installed Package Structure
===========================

::

     ┌── bin
     ├── include
     │   └── qpl
     |       ├── c_api
     |       └── qpl.h
     |
     ├── lib or lib64
     |   ├── cmake
     |   └── libqpl.a
     |
     └── share/QPL
         ├── configs
         └── scripts

Executables for tests and benchmarks framework are available in ``bin/`` folder.

Configuration files and scripts for Intel® IAA
(see :ref:`accelerator_configuration_reference_link` for more details)
are available in ``share/QPL/`` folder.

::

     └── lib or lib64
         ├── libqpl.so
         ├── libqpl.so.X
         ├── libqpl.so.X.Y.Z
         └── pkgconfig
             └── qpl.pc

On Linux OS a dynamic library is installed at ``<install_path>/lib/``, where **X**, **Y**, **Z**
is the Intel QPL version when the ``-QPL_LIBRARY_TYPE`` is set to ``SHARED``.

Metadata file ``qpl.pc`` for pkg-config support is installed to `<install_path>/lib/pkgconfig`.

.. warning::

   The pkg-config file is only generated/supported for the shared library (``-DQPL_LIBRARY_TYPE=SHARED``)
   build with dynamic loading of ``libaccel-config`` (``-DDYNAMIC_LOADING_LIBACCEL_CONFIG=ON``).

Examples are located in ``<qpl_library>/build/examples/``.

Intel QPL could be easily integrated to other CMake projects once installed.
Use ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` to point to the existing installation
and add the next lines to your ``CMakeLists.txt``:

.. code-block:: shell

   find_package(QPL CONFIG REQUIRED)
   target_link_libraries(app_name QPL::qpl)

Building the Documentation
**************************

Prerequisites
=============

To build the offline version of the documentation, the following tools must be installed:

- `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`__ 1.8.17 or higher (e.g., with ``apt install doxygen``)
- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ 3.8.5 or higher (e.g., with ``apt install python3.X``)
- `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ 7.2.6 or higher (e.g., with ``pip3 install sphinx``)
- `sphinx_book_theme <https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/>`__ 1.1.2 or higher (e.g., with ``pip3 install sphinx-book-theme``)
- `Breathe <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ 4.35.0 or higher (e.g., with ``pip3 install breathe``)

.. attention::

   To avoid incompatibility between `Breathe`, `sphinx_book_theme` and `Sphinx` versions, use `requirements.txt` file to install guaranteed compatible combination of components.

   .. code-block:: shell

       pip3 install -r <qpl_library>/doc/requirements.txt

Build Steps
===========

To generate the full offline documentation from sources,
use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   /bin/bash <qpl_library>/doc/_get_docs.sh

.. attention::

   Linux* OS shell (or Windows* OS shell alternatives) is required to run the
   documentation build script.

After the generation process is completed, open the ``<qpl_library>/doc/build/html/index.html`` file.
