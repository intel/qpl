CRC-64
######


This operation computes an arbitrary CRC up to 64-bytes in size.

The polynomial is expressed in the normal or “not bit-reversed” form in
the job's ``crc64_poly`` field. The most-significant bit of the polynomial
(which is always 1) is not expressed, and the next most-significant bit
is written to bit-63 of the field. That is, the polynomial is written to
the high end of the field. If the polynomial is for a 64-bit CRC, then
bit-0 would also be set. If the CRC is smaller, then the
least-significant bit set will be at a higher bit position.

For example, the CRC32 used by DEFLATE is defined by the 33-bit
polynomial 104c11db7. To generate this CRC with the ``qpl_crc64`` operation,
one would set the ``crc64_poly`` field to: *04c11db700000000*. Since the
least-significant set bit is bit-32, then the size of the resulting CRC
would be 64-32 or 32.

By default, the data is viewed as Little Endian. If the
``QPL_FLAG_CRC64_BE`` flag is used, the data is viewed as Big Endian.

When the data is LE, bit-0 of each byte is the least significant.
Additionally, bit-0 of byte-0 is the least significant bit of the
output. If the polynomial is smaller than 64-bits, the CRC is found in
the high end of the ``crc64`` field.

When the data is BE, bit-0 of each byte is the most significant. Bit-7
of byte-7 of the result is then the least significant bit. If the
polynomial is smaller than 64-bits, the CRC is found in the low end of
the ``crc64`` field.

This operation may not be linked, so the initial CRC is logically always
0, but many CRC invert (in a bitwise sense) the initial CRC and the
final CRC. To achieve this, the application should use the
``QPL_FLAG_CRC64_INV`` flag. **Note** that the number of bits to be inverted
is implied by the size of the polynomial (i.e. determined by where the
least-significant set bit is found).

Here is some well-known CRC's, with corresponding settings and place to
find the result:
