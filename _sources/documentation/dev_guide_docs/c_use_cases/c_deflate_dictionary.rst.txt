Deflate with Dictionary
#######################


Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) supports compression with 
preset dictionary by implementing several auxiliary functions that work 
with ``qpl_dictionary``.


Building Dictionary
*******************


First, you need to allocate the buffer for ``qpl_dictionary``. The size
of that buffer can be obtained by the ``qpl_get_dictionary_size(...)``
function.

.. code:: c

   qpl_get_dictionary_size(sw_compression_level, hw_compression_level, size_t);


This function accepts 3 arguments: software and hardware compression
levels, and the size (in bytes) of a raw dictionary.

To do the compression only on software path, set the
``hw_compression_level`` parameter to ``HW_NONE``. In this case, the
buffer size needed for ``qpl_dictionary`` will be less.


After allocating the buffer, ``qpl_build_dictionary(...)`` function
should be used to fill the ``qpl_dictionary``.


.. code:: c

   qpl_build_dictionary(qpl_dictionary *dict_ptr,
                        sw_compression_level sw_level,
                        hw_compression_level hw_level,
                        const uint8_t *raw_dict_ptr,
                        size_t raw_dict_size))


This function accepts pointer to allocated dictionary, software and
hardware compression levels, pointer to array containing dictionary to
use, and its length. **Note**: if dictionary length is larger than 4,096
bytes, then only the last 4,096 bytes will be used.

Several auxiliary functions can be used to work with dictionary:

-  ``qpl_get_dictionary_id(..)`` and ``qpl_set_dictionary_id(...)`` sets
   and gets dictionary ID of ``qpl_dictionary`` (can be used in case of
   zlib header).
-  ``qpl_get_existing_dict_size(...)`` is used to get the size (in
   bytes) of the ``qpl_dictionary`` structure built.


Compressing with Dictionary
***************************


Compression with preset dictionary can be done for dynamic, fixed,
static, and canned compression modes. In order to do the compression,
the ``qpl_job->dictionary`` field should point to the built dictionary:

.. code:: c

   // ...
   job_ptr->op = qpl_op_compress;
   job_ptr->flags = QPL_FLAG_FIRST | QPL_FLAG_LAST | QPL_FLAG_DYNAMIC;
   job_ptr->dictionary = dictionary_ptr;

   qpl_status = qpl_execute_job(job_ptr);


The dictionary cannot be set in the middle of the compression stream.
The job should be marked as FIRST.


To decompress the stream previously compressed with the dictionary, the
same dictionary should be specified for the first decompression job:


.. code:: c

   // ...
   job_ptr->op = qpl_op_decompress;
   job_ptr->flags = QPL_FLAG_FIRST | QPL_FLAG_LAST;
   job_ptr->dictionary = dictionary_ptr;

   qpl_status = qpl_execute_job(job_ptr);
