Job Structure
#############


The Intel® Query Processing Library (Intel® QPL) 
job structure :c:struct:`qpl_job` contains three types of data:

1. Parameters defining the job to be done.

2. Results of the job performed.

3. Internal state.

Note that some fields in the job structure are of type 1 and 2 at the
same time; that is, they are both inputs and outputs. This point will
become clear in the following.

We introduce fields in the job structure that are common across operations.

The field :c:member:`qpl_job.op` defines the operation to be done and has a
value in enum :c:enum:`qpl_operation`.

The input buffer for the operation is described by two fields:
:c:member:`qpl_job.next_in_ptr` and :c:member:`qpl_job.available_in`. The
first points to the start of the input data, and the second gives the
length of the input data (or equivalently, the number of bytes of the input
data). If the job completes successfully, the :c:member:`qpl_job.next_in_ptr`
field should be advanced by the value of :c:member:`qpl_job.available_in`,
and the value of :c:member:`qpl_job.available_in` field should become zero.

The output buffer for the operation is described by two similar fields:
:c:member:`qpl_job.next_out_ptr` and :c:member:`qpl_job.available_out`.
When the job completes, the :c:member:`qpl_job.next_out_ptr` field should
be advanced by the number of bytes that was written, and the value of
:c:member:`qpl_job.available_out` field should describe the remaining number
of bytes unused.

The :c:member:`qpl_job.flags` field defines flags that affect the operation.
Each flag is represented by one of the 32 bits. To set the bit flags, use the
bitwise OR operator (``|``), for example,
``QPL_FLAG_FIRST | QPL_FLAG_LAST | QPL_FLAG_DYNAMIC_HUFFMAN``.
The setting of flags will be introduced in later sections.

Two output fields :c:member:`qpl_job.total_in` and :c:member:`qpl_job.total_out`
return the cumulative number of bytes read and written.

For applicable operations that return a CRC-32 and a 16-bit XOR checksum, the
results are contained in the fields :c:member:`qpl_job.crc` and
:c:member:`qpl_job.xor_checksum`. By default, the CRC-32 uses the polynomial
``0x104c11db7``, which follows ITU-T Recommendation V.42. If the flag
``QPL_FLAG_CRC32C`` is specified in :c:member:`qpl_job.flags`, then the
polynomial ``0x11edc6f41`` is used, which follows RFC 3720. To compute the
16-bit XOR checksum, the data is treated as 16-bit words. If the data has an
odd number of bytes, the final byte is zero-extended to 16 bits.

For an operation like decompression, which generates a stream of bytes, the
output stream always ends at a byte boundary. For an operation like scan,
which generates a stream of bits, the stream is zero-padded to a byte boundary
before being written. The information of where the data actual ends can be
obtained from the :c:member:`qpl_job.last_bit_offset` field. When the output stream
does not end at a byte boundary, this field contains the number of bits written
to the last byte. When the output stream ends at a byte boundary, the value
of this field is 0 (not 8).
